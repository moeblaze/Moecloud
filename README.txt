MBCC SPORTS — SURGICAL NFL PATCH
---------------------------------
This package includes a drop-in replacement for ONLY the NFL section on sports.html.
No layout or CSS changes. Just paste this section in place of your current <section id="nfl">…</section>.

Steps:
1) Open your site file: /sports.html
2) Find the block that starts with: <section id="nfl">
3) Replace that ENTIRE block with the contents of nfl-section.html in this ZIP.
4) Save & deploy, then hard-refresh: https://www.moecommunitycloud.com/sports.html?cb=nfl1

Notes:
- This patch avoids JavaScript/CSP issues by baking the Week 1 finals directly into HTML.
- You can later re-enable JS hydration with an external /assets/js/sports.js and /data/*.json.
