MBCC — RESTORE PACK (built 2025-09-09)

What this does
- Restores ONLY the files we unintentionally changed:
  • index.html (unchanged layout; sponsor image fills the glowing box; uses assets/sponsors/channels4_profile (1).jpg)
  • apps.html (restored toolbox layout and styling)
  • assets/sponsors/channels4_profile (1).jpg (image included)

How to install
1) Upload index.html and apps.html to your site root, overwriting the current files.
2) Create folder assets/sponsors/ if it doesn't exist and upload the image inside.
3) Hard refresh each page: index.html?cb=restore and apps.html?cb=restore

Notes
- No global CSS or JS changed. Your existing assets/style.css and assets/consent.js remain untouched.
- If any content page still looks off, tell me which file and I’ll ship JUST that file without touching others.
