Azure SWA Direct (Option B)
===========================
Use this if you want Azure Static Web Apps to directly serve moecommunitycloud.com (no Vercel in front).

Steps
1) Ensure this workflow exists in your repo at `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps.yml`.
   - For a pure static site in the repo root, `app_location: "/"` and `output_location: ""` are correct.
   - If you build into a folder (e.g., `dist`), set `output_location: "dist"`.
2) In your GitHub repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, create:
   - `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` (paste from the Azure SWA portal → Deployment token).
3) In Azure Portal → your SWA → Custom domains:
   - Add **www.moecommunitycloud.com** and follow the **External provider** steps (CNAME to `*.azurestaticapps.net`). See Microsoft docs for details.
   - Optional: also set the apex **moecommunitycloud.com** using an ALIAS/ANAME if your DNS supports it, and redirect apex → www.
4) Push a commit to `main`. The workflow will build and deploy to **Production**.

Verification
- Visit the autogenerated Azure SWA domain (e.g., `https://<your-app>.azurestaticapps.net`) and confirm your latest changes (hero banner, NFL section) are live.
- Then visit https://www.moecommunitycloud.com and verify the same content.
- If the Azure site is updated but the custom domain is not, the domain isn't mapped to this SWA (or still mapped to Vercel).
