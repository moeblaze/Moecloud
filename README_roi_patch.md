# ROI Patch (Brand‑Safe)
Replaces `/training/roi.html` with a version that:
- Keeps your existing look (uses `../assets/css/styles.css` and `../assets/js/main.js`)
- Adds CTA row in results (`See Packages`, `Partner Models`, `Attach One‑Pager`)
- Includes CSV export + optional GA4 events in JS

## Install
1. Copy `training/roi.html` from this zip into your repo, replacing the existing file.
2. Commit → PR → merge to `main`. Azure SWA will redeploy automatically.
