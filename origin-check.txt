MBCC Deploy Check
Origin: this file is from the repo at 2025-09-08T11:16:48.859557Z

How to use:
1) Place this file at the repo root as 'origin-check.txt' and commit.
2) After deploy, open:
   - Azure SWA default domain: https://YOUR_SWA_DEFAULT_DOMAIN.azurestaticapps.net/origin-check.txt
   - Vercel domain: https://www.moecommunitycloud.com/origin-check.txt
If Azure shows the file but the custom domain does not, your DNS/domain is NOT pointing at Azure.
