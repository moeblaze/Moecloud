# Packages Page — Full Update

This replaces `/playbooks/packages.html` with a **4-tier** packages page:
- No‑Code Playbook
- Integration (AI Assist)
- White‑Label Ecosystem
- Enterprise Transformation ($1M+)

Also includes:
- Feature comparison table
- Enhanced ROI + Quote widget (tier presets)
- JSON‑LD Product/Offer schema for SEO

## Install
1. Copy `playbooks/packages.html` into your repo, replacing the old file.
2. Commit → PR → merge to `main` (Azure SWA should deploy green).
3. Verify `/playbooks/packages.html` shows 4 tiers and the ROI widget.

## Notes
- Pricing numbers here are **estimates** for positioning; adjust as needed.
- GA events: `package_estimated`, `package_export` (if GA is enabled).
- Your **auto-sitemap** workflow will pick up updates automatically.
