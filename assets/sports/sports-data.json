        "body": "The NFL\u2019s first regular\u2011season game in Brazil delivered a jolt: Justin Herbert threw for 318 yards\nand                 three touchdowns as the Los Angeles Chargers beat the Kansas City Chiefs 27\u201321\nat S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s                 Neo Qu\u00edmica Arena. Herbert\u2019s late first\u2011down scramble helped bleed\nthe clock after the Chiefs cut the                 lead to six, snapping L.A.\u2019s seven\u2011game skid to\ntheir AFC West rivals. The opener also marked the                 league\u2019s expansion push into South\nAmerica, drawing a raucous, soccer\u2011style crowd and global                 attention.\nBeyond the scoreline, the game offered storylines for Week 1 and beyond. Chiefs WR Xavier Worthy\nexited with a shoulder injury and will be evaluated stateside, while an on\u2011field dust\u2011up between\nChargers DT Teair Tart and Travis Kelce briefly overshadowed the action. For L.A., new head coach\nJim Harbaugh\u2019s balanced attack featured timely shots to Quentin Johnston and Keenan Allen plus\nclock\u2011milking runs to close. For Kansas City, Patrick Mahomes extended plays as usual but faced\npressure in high\u2011leverage moments, a trend to watch as the Chiefs try to three\u2011peat.\nThe Brazil debut checked the NFL\u2019s boxes: big\u2011market buzz, compelling finish, and star power. If the\nBolts sustain this formula, the AFC West may be more open than assumed."

        "body": "The Super Bowl champion Eagles opened their title defense with a 24\u201320 win over the Cowboys in a\nlightning\u2011delayed thriller at Lincoln Financial Field. Jalen Hurts powered Philadelphia with two\nrushing touchdowns and a turnover\u2011free night, while the defense flipped the script after halftime\nand                 pitched a shutout down the stretch. A 65\u2011minute delay froze the scoreboard at\n24\u201320 late in the third,                 and when play resumed, Philly\u2019s front sealed it with\npressure and sure tackling.                                  Dallas showed flashes in Brian\nSchottenheimer\u2019s head\u2011coaching debut\u2014more motion, play\u2011action and                 discipline\u2014but\ncritical fourth\u2011quarter drops derailed a potential comeback. Even so, the Cowboys\nallowed zero sacks and kept the run game viable, hints that this offense can be more multiple in\n2025.                 For the champs, the opener showcased a familiar formula: Hurts\u2019 red\u2011zone\nsolving, situational defense,                 and special\u2011teams steadiness. Circle the rematch; the\nNFC East race looks spicy already."

The U.S. sprint star swept the\n100/200 at the USATF                 Championships, clocking 10.65\u2014the world lead and fifth\u2011fastest\nall time\u2014then dominated Diamond League                 fields in Silesia and Brussels (10.76),\nstaying unbeaten at 100m this season. Factor in her relay gold                 pedigree and\nincreasingly sharper starts, and our pick is Jefferson\u2011Wooden to claim the \u2018World\u2019s\nFastest Woman\u2019 title in Tokyo.                                  The field is stacked: reigning world\nchampion Sha\u2019Carri Richardson remains dangerous, Britain\u2019s                 Daryll Neita has trimmed\ntenths, and Saint Lucia\u2019s Julien Alfred lurks with big\u2011meet speed. Yet\nJefferson\u2011Wooden\u2019s 2025 r\u00e9sum\u00e9 blends raw time, championship reps, and tactical execution better\nthan                 anyone. Unless curveballs\u2014weather, rounds fatigue, or a perfect\u2011start\nrival\u2014intervene, the tape points                 to Melissa on top in the National Stadium."
