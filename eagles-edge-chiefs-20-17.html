      <h1>Eagles Edge Chiefs 20-17 in Super Bowl Rematch</h1>
      <p class="dek">Philadelphia survives Kansas City’s comeback attempt with defense and late heroics.</p>
      <div class="meta">Published September 15, 2025</div>
      <p>The Philadelphia Eagles leaned on resilience and a smothering defense to outlast the Kansas City Chiefs, 20-17, in a highly anticipated rematch of Super Bowl LVII.</p>
<ul><li>Safety Andrew Mukuba delivered the momentum swing with a key interception, setting up a short-field score.</li></ul>
<li>Jalen Hurts kept drives alive with his legs and the “Tush Push,” extending a crucial 4th-and-goal.</li>
<li>Kansas City’s mistakes proved costly — Travis Kelce dropped a would-be touchdown, and miscommunications slowed Mahomes.</li>
<p>The Eagles improve to 2-0, reminding the NFL that their championship window is wide open. For Kansas City, a 0-2 start raises questions about their supporting cast.</p>
